File IO Lib Options
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

See defines in fat_opts.h:

FATFS_IS_LITTLE_ENDIAN 	[1/0]
  Which endian is your system? Set to 1 for little endian, 0 for big endian.

FATFS_MAX_LONG_FILENAME	[260]
  By default, 260 characters (max LFN length). Increase this to support greater path depths.

FATFS_MAX_OPEN_FILES 	
  The more files you wish to have concurrently open, the greater this number should be.
  This increases the number of FL_FILE file structures in the library, each of these is around 1K in size (assuming 512 byte sectors).

FAT_BUFFERED_SECTOR
  Minimum is 1, more increases performance.
  This defines how many FAT table sectors can be buffered.

FATFS_INC_WRITE_SUPPORT
  Support file write functionality.

FAT_SECTOR_SIZE
  Sector size used by buffers. Most likely to be 512 bytes (standard for ATA/IDE).

FAT_PRINTF
  A define that allows the File IO library to print to console/stdout. 
  Provide your own printf function if printf not available.
